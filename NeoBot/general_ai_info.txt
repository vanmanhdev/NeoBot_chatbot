Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. It is a field of computer science. AI researchers study how to build agents that can perceive the environment, learn, reason, solve problems, and act towards achieving goals.
There are different types of AI. Narrow AI (or Weak AI) is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of narrow AI. Strong AI (also known as Artificial General Intelligence or AGI) describes a hypothetical AI which would have the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. This remains largely theoretical.
Machine learning is a central part of AI research and applications. It involves algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from and make decisions based on data, without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers.
